<h1>Lemmings Game</h1>
<h3> Programming Final Project </h3>

<p>This project emulates the game Lemmings. After following the steps indicated on the project requisites, a final functional version has been reached. The code has been designed taking into account future maintainability, code understandability and new game functions.</p>

<p>It's been created with Python and Pyxel GUI.</p>

<h4>Instructions:</h4>
<p>The main goal is to take as many lemmings as possible to the exit gate. You can do it by using three type of tools: <strong>blockers</strong> to prevent the lemmings from falling or if you need them to change direction, <strong>umbrellas</strong> for lemmings to go down without dying and <strong>ladders</strong> for lemmings to go up to higher platforms.</p>

<h4>Controls: </h4>
<p><strong>Arrow keys:</strong> to move your cursor to place tools. </p>
<p><strong>Enter:</strong> to change the level if it's an impossible randomly created one.</p>
<p><strong>B key:</strong> to place a blocker.</p>
<p><strong>L/K keys:</strong> to place left/right ladders.</p>
<p><strong>Space key:</strong> to place an umbrella.</p>
<p><strong>S key:</strong> to stop/resume the music.</p>
<p><strong>Q key:</strong> to exit the game.</p>
